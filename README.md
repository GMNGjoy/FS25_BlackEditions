# FS25 Black Editions
I've got a thing for BLACK vehicles & tools, and in many cases the basegame of FS25 doesn't support coloring in the way I would prefer... but it's easy enough to change!

This Mod / Repository will be my collection of **BLACK** editions of the vehicles I choose to play with. Many of those vehicles will have one or more of the following features:

- In-depth Color Selection (so I can "black it out")
- Additional engine configurations
- Additional capacity configurations
- Working speed upgrades (nothing crazy)

I create this for myself, but want to share with the community.

- **DO NOT UPLOAD** anywhere else
- Do not steal / edit for your own purposes - contact me first.
- I don't take requests
